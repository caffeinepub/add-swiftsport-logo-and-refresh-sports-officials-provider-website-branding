  "summary": "Frontend updates add stronger marketing copy, integrate new hero/supporting images, update footer/contact details, and introduce a floating chatbot-style lead capture UI. However, the backend persistence and schema for referee-request leads (REQ-6) is not implemented as specified (no stable storage, wrong fields, no createdAt), and the frontend submission currently adapts to the old backend schema rather than storing the captured referee-request fields.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-6",
      "requirement": "Persist submitted chatbot lead-capture requests in the Motoko backend with a stable data structure including all collected fields plus createdAt, and expose methods to create and list requests (single-actor in backend/main.mo).",
      "reason": "The backend stores a non-stable in-memory Map keyed by email and the stored data schema is unrelated to referee requests (jobSeeker/foundingInterest/etc.), with no createdAt field. The frontend hook explicitly notes the backend schema mismatch and does not send the collected referee-request fields (sport, numberOfOfficials, dateTime, location, competitionLevel) to the backend for persistence.",

      "requirement": "Add new marketing images under frontend/public/assets/generated and reference them from the frontend.",
      "reason": "The frontend references the required generated image paths, but the diff summary does not show the actual static image files being added under frontend/public/assets/generated (binary/static assets are not present in the LLM-readable diff). Based on provided evidence alone, the asset addition itself cannot be confirmed.",
