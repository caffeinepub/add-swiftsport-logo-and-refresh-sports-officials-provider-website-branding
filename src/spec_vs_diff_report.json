  "summary": "Frontend gating and query enabling for the admin Requests Review section appears implemented, along with improved admin-view error messaging. However, the backend does not include the required `isCallerAdmin` query method even though the frontend now calls `actor.isCallerAdmin()`, which would likely cause method-missing errors and break admin detection.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Ensure the backend actor exposes a stable admin-check method used by the frontend (`isCallerAdmin`) that returns a boolean without trapping, so the frontend can reliably gate admin-only UI and queries.",
      "reason": "Frontend now calls `actor.isCallerAdmin()` via `useIsCallerAdmin`, but `backend/main.mo` does not define any public `isCallerAdmin : async Bool` query method in the shown diff. This would prevent reliable admin detection and could trigger method-missing/throwing behavior.",
