  "summary": "REQ-2 appears implemented via updates to frontend/LIVE_URLS.md. REQ-1 is not evidenced (no DEPLOYMENT.md change shown). REQ-3 is only partially evidenced: the centralized utility is enhanced and documentation/comments were added, but the diff summary does not show frontend-wide refactors away from window.location.origin/hardcoded domains for absolute URL generation. Some unrelated UI/form changes were made.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",

      "reason": "The diff summary does not show any modification to frontend/DEPLOYMENT.md, so the required documentation fixes and the broken code fence replacement cannot be verified as implemented.",

      "reason": "While frontend/src/utils/publicSiteBaseUrl.ts was updated and guidance was added (e.g., comments in index.html and urlParams.ts), the diff summary does not provide evidence that existing absolute URL generation across the frontend was refactored to use this utility (beyond documentation/comments).",
